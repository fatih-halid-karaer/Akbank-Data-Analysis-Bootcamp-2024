# Akbank-Data-Analysis-Bootcamp-2024

In my project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a dataset using various techniques and methods, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Basic Statistical Analysis, Visualization, Analysis of Inter-variable Relationships, Feature Selection, and Feature Engineering.

During the Exploratory Data Analysis phase, I aimed to understand the structure of the dataset, discover patterns, and identify important features. Following this, I thoroughly examined the dataset to detect and address any missing or corrupted data during the Data Cleaning and Preprocessing stage. Additionally, outlier values were identified and handled appropriately.

Basic Statistical Analysis allowed me to delve deeper into the dataset by examining statistical properties such as mean, standard deviation, median, and mode. Through Visualization, I visually inspected the data using tools like matplotlib and seaborn, which enabled me to understand relationships and distributions between variables.

Analysis of Inter-variable Relationships involved exploring correlations between variables, providing insights into their relationships and determining their importance for the project. Furthermore, Feature Selection techniques were applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and optimize model performance.

In the Feature Engineering phase, I analyzed existing features and created new ones to enhance the dataset's modeling capabilities and achieve better results. This included addressing outlier and missing data issues to ensure data integrity and reliability.

Overall, by applying these techniques and methods, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, improved model performance, reduced overfitting risks, and facilitated easier data analysis and interpretation, ultimately contributing to the success of the project.
